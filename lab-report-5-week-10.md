# Lab Report 4 Week 8

In lab 9, you experimented with the many tests provided under the test-files/ folder. For this lab report, choose any two tests from the 652 tests where your implementation (or a representative implementation from your group) had different answers than the implementation we provided for lab 9. The tests with different answers should correspond to different bugs – that is, you couldn’t easily fix both with one code change.
